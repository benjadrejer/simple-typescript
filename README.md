Simple Typescript App bundled with Parcel.

It utilizes google maps to show a couple of markers, which contains randomly generated (using Faker) user & company info..
Man purpose of this app was or me to get experience with Typescript, namely:
Type Annotations
Type Definitions
Interfaces
Design Patterns

Note:
You'll need you own google maps KEY, inserted in index.html, for the app to work.

Running the app (inside the repository):
